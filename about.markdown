This is a peaceful place where I store my knowledge and ideas. I genuinely believe that documenting stuff is a good way to learn, so I might just do it anyway.

When I have time, I may read some stuff, write some code and leave it here. It's my way of having fun. If you find something useful, that's good for you :D.
